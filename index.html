    <p><strong>Question 1:</strong> Talk about how you made your site and why you chose the tools you did. Briefly explain one challenge you experienced in setting up this site and how you overcame it.</p>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> I mainly used basic setups like HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Even though these three are the most fundamental tools, I made sure to apply best practices such as clean coding and using an external CSS stylesheet instead of inline styles. One challenge I experienced was getting familiar with the platform. It was actually my first time using Netlify, so I had to read through the documentation to understand the deployment process.</p>

    <p><strong>Question 2:</strong> What did you think of our service during the time you used it? Provide some constructive criticism or some features that impressed you.</p>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> It was actually very intuitive to use! When I linked my GitHub repository, it deployed right away, which was great. The UI feels familiar similar to how technical platforms work so it was easy to navigate. I haven't experienced any issues so far, so I can’t provide constructive feedback yet, but I’ll be sure to share if I encounter anything in the future.</p>

    <p><strong>Question 4:</strong> Provide a link to documentation for a technical/developer-focused product, which you think are well done, and explain why you think they are well done.</p>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> I find the React.js documentation to be one of the most well-done technical resources out there. It's very accessible to both new and experienced developers. For starters, it provides a clear installation guide with helpful visual aids that make setup easy to follow. Beyond that, it includes practical examples of how to use the framework, which adds a lot of value for someone trying to learn or apply it in real-world scenarios. Another thing I appreciate is how the documentation links out to related resources like blogs, community forums, and API references all organized in a way that’s easy to explore. It even has update logs available, which are useful if you want to check for changes that might affect specific packages. Overall, it feels very user-centric, thoughtfully designed, and easy to navigate, all of which make learning React a much smoother experience.</p>

  <p><strong>Question 5:</strong> Explain, in a couple of paragraphs, what you think are two major challenges around DNS configuration for less-technical customers hosting websites.</p>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> For me, one of the major challenges around DNS configuration for less-technical users is understanding that DNS settings consist of various record types, each serving a different purpose. It can get confusing because there are so many types, and the names don’t always give a clear idea of what they do. For instance, an “A record” might not intuitively sound like it’s related to pointing a domain to an IP address, but that’s essentially what it does.</p>
  <p>The second challenge is the assumption that website hosting platforms automatically manage everything, including DNS settings. Many users think that once their site is deployed to a server, that same server also controls their DNS but in reality, DNS records are typically managed where the domain was purchased. It’s a common misconception, and explaining that separation can be difficult for someone who’s never handled domain configurations before.</p>

  <p><strong>Question 6:</strong> A customer writes in to Support saying simply that their “site won’t build”. You have access to their build logs, and there you see this error: Build failed due to a user error: Build script returned non-zero exit code: 2. You have no more information than this and the site’s source repository is private so you cannot test the build yourself. How would you troubleshoot this issue? What steps would you take? Also, please compose your best customer-facing first response.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> First, I would acknowledge the customer's frustration and ensure they feel supported. Even though the error might be coming from their code, it’s important to show empathy and assure them we’re actively looking into it. I’d begin by checking the build logs in detail to identify any specific file paths, failed scripts, or package manager errors that may have triggered the exit code 2. Although I can’t test the build myself, I would provide the customer with common causes of this type of error such as missing dependencies, incorrect script paths, or syntax issues and ask guided questions to narrow things down.</p>
  
  <p>Next, I’d request access to a minimal reproducible example or ask them to share the specific build command and configuration they're using in their setup. That way, we can offer more targeted help without needing full repository access.</p>
  
  <p>I'll send this message too while troubleshooting:</p>
  
  <p>
    Hi!,<br>
    Thanks for reaching out! We’re currently reviewing your build issue and noticed that the build is failing due to a script returning a non-zero exit code: 2. This typically indicates that something in your build command might be exiting with an error.<br><br>
    While we don’t have access to your source repository to run the build ourselves, here are a few things that might help you get started:
    <ul>
      <li>Check your build scripts for typos or missing files.</li>
      <li>Make sure all necessary dependencies are listed and installed.</li>
      <li>Review any recent changes to see if something broke the build process.</li>
    </ul>
    If you could share your build command or any recent updates made to your project, we’d be happy to take a closer look and help guide you through it.<br><br>
    Looking forward to helping you get this resolved!<br><br>
    Best regards,<br>
    Wyman

  <p><strong>Question 7:</strong> How would you set up an http 301 status redirect from “/netlify/anything” on your site, to https://www.google.com/search?q=anything. Please provide the redirect formatting here. Now, how about a proxy redirect? Please add that proxy redirect rule directly to your site. (Please add the proxy redirect to your website!)</p>

  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> I basically used the netlify.toml file to configure both redirects. This file is located in the main directory of my project together with the base files and is automatically picked up by Netlify during deployment. It’s the simplest and most native way to handle redirects on a Netlify-hosted static site without using other dependencies in my opinion.</p>

  <p>To set up the required 301 redirect from /netlify/anything to Google Search, I added the following rule:</p>

  <pre><code>[[redirects]]
from = "/netlify/anything"
to = "https://www.google.com/search?q=anything"
status = 301
force = true
</code></pre>

  <p>This means that any visit to /netlify/anything will result in a permanent redirect (HTTP 301) to the exact Google Search URL with the word "anything" as the search term. I used force = true to ensure it overrides any existing file with that name in my build.</p>

  <p>For the proxy redirect, I used a public test API that allows proxying, because Google Search does not support being proxied (it blocks such requests with CORS and security protections). Here's the working proxy redirect I added:</p>

<pre><code>[[redirects]]
from = "/proxy-posts"
to = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts"
status = 200
</code></pre>

  <p>This basically allows me to demonstrate a working 200 redirect. Both redirects are managed in netlify.toml for simplicity and maintainability.</p>

    <p><strong>Question 8:</strong> Please attempt to deploy a <a href="https://docs.netlify.com/functions/get-started/?fn-language=ts">function</a> on our service. This need not be complicated. It could be "Hello World". Note that failure to deploy is not failing the exercise! Whether you have trouble or not, please describe what you experienced and how you attempted to troubleshoot any issues you encountered.</p>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> I deployed a basic Netlify Function that dynamically returns the server's current date and time. I followed the typical Netlify function setup by creating a netlify/functions folder in my project directory, and inside that, I added a time.js. Then in my index.html, I wrote a small JavaScript function that fetches the time from the deployed endpoint at /.netlify/functions/time.js and displays it inside. When I pushed this setup to GitHub and connected it to Netlify, the function deployed automatically and no extra configuration was needed beyond the netlify.toml. At first, I saw “Failed to load time” in the browser, which made me realize the function might not have been recognized yet. Once deployed, everything worked smoothly. The function displayed the correct server time on the live site, confirming that the function was properly deployed and the frontend was receiving it. This process gave me hands-on experience setting up and troubleshooting serverless functions using Netlify’s native integration, and I’d feel confident implementing more dynamic features this way in the future.</p>

  <p><strong>Question 9:</strong> We understand you don't know anything about our internal procedures at this stage, but we want you to explain at a high level how you'd react to this situation: You receive a report of a severe security issue on www.netlify.com. You can't immediately confirm the report, so what steps might you take to investigate or substantiate the report? What might you say to the reporter, even though we haven't confirmed their assertion yet, that will instill confidence that our business is very concerned about security? You believe there is a reasonable chance the report is correct and the problem is very large and impactful. How might you escalate?</p>

  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> First, I’d thank the reporter and let them know we take security very seriously. Even without confirming the issue yet, I’d reassure them that it’s being reviewed by the appropriate team and that we appreciate them flagging it.</p>

  <p>I’d then try to reproduce the issue using the details they provided, check any relevant logs if I had access, and gather as much context as possible to better understand the scope. Since it seems impactful, I’d escalate right away to the Security or Engineering team, including all the details from the report and what I’ve found so far.</p>

  <p>Throughout the process, I’d keep the reporter updated, even just to let them know the issue is still being reviewed. I think clear, respectful communication goes a long way in showing we care and take this seriously.</p>

  <p>Here's what I'll reply to the reporter:</p>

  <blockquote>
    Hi,<br><br>
    Thank you for reaching out and for taking the time to report this issue. We take all security concerns extremely seriously, and your report has our full attention.<br><br>
    Although we haven’t yet confirmed the details on our end, we understand the potential impact of the issue you described and are treating it as a priority. Our internal teams are currently reviewing the information you provided to assess and validate the situation thoroughly.<br><br>
    In the meantime, if you have any additional context, logs, or reproduction steps that might help speed up our investigation, we’d greatly appreciate it. We’ll keep you updated on our progress and will follow up as soon as we have more information.<br><br>
    We value responsible disclosure and your help in keeping our platform and users secure. Thank you again for bringing this to our attention.<br><br>
    Best regards,<br>
    Wyman
